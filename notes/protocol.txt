Client and server use pre-shared password for authentication.
Client sends password salt to use to the server
Server sends message advertising their capabilities (32 bit number representing max number of assigned jobs).

Regular protocol starts:

Client side messages to server (sizes are 32 bit unsigned integers)

'f' .. 3 bytes padding .. size of file .. file id .. 4 bytes padding - client message to server that file to be loaded is being sent, with specified per-client file id
'j' .. 3 bytes padding .. file id .. job id .. size of argument - client message to start a job with some data, with specified per-client job id

Server side messages to client

'f' .. 3 bytes padding .. job id .. size of argument .. 4 bytes padding - server message to the client that a job is finished, follows with data produced.
