Client and server use pre-shared password for authentication.
Client sends password salt to use to the server
Server sends message advertising their capabilities (32 bit number representing max number of assigned jobs).

Regular protocol starts:

Client side messages to server (sizes are 32 bit unsigned integers)

'f' .. 3 bytes padding .. size of file .. file id .. 4 bytes padding - header for file to be loaded, with specified per-client file id. File sent afterwards, overwrites previously used file if any
'j' .. 3 bytes padding .. file id .. job id .. 4 bytes padding - start a job with some data, with specified per-client job id. Data follows (length determined by file id)

Server side messages to client

'f' .. 3 bytes padding .. job id .. size of returned data .. 4 bytes padding - server message to the client that a job is finished, follows with data produced.
